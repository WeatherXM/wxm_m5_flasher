## Updating your firmware with Flasher Tool
If you are currently using an M5 Miner with firmware version 0.3.11, it's essential to update your device using the Flasher Tool. This version is considered obsolete and cannot receive updates through the "Over The Air" (OTA) method due to significant differences in the underlying operating system. To ensure your M5 Miner continues to operate efficiently and receive rewards, you must perform a full firmware flash using a USB cable.
